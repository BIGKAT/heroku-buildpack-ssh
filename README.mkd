Heroku buildpack: SSH
=====================

Reads and sets ssh private key from an environment variable.  Designed to be used with [heroku-buildpack-compose](https://github.com/bwhmather/heroku-buildpack-compose) to allow build process to access private resources without storing unencrypted keys in the repository.


Usage
-----

This buildpack currently depends on the [user env compile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/labs-user-env-compile) labs addon to be able to access the ssh key.  To enable run:

    heroku labs:enable user-env-compile

Set `SSH_KEY` variable to private key:

    heroku config:set SSH_KEY=`cat /path/to/id_rsa`

The key must not require a password to use.

Enable the compose buildpack

    heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/bwhmather/heroku-buildpack-compose.git

Create `.buildpacks` file:

    https://github.com/${YOUR_NAME}/heroku-buildpack-ssh.git
    ssh://git@github.com:${YOUR_NAME}/top-secret-buildpack.git
    https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-something-something.git

This buildpack should obviously be loaded before buildpacks requiring access to private repositories.

It is highly recommended that you use your own fork as updates may break backwards compatibility.
